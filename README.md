You go through a level and only have one minute before you die, and when you restart the level your previous characters ghost does what you did before you died.

You only have one heart.  You can share it with fallen comrades to help them to safety.  There are enemies to kill you!

You only have one... Item
-------------------------

Levels are scattered with items that could be used to solve puzzles or fend off enemies.

You can only have one item at a time.

Shovel	-> Dig through level go around enemies
Axe 	-> Chop down tree to cross gap.
	-> Use on enemies?
NadeGun	-> Use to shoot enemies (only one bullet though! :)
Rope	-> Traversing hazards / gaps



You only have one... FLAMETHROWER!!!
------------------------------------

You're in the level.  It's dark as hell.  The game says "Use it...".  You "use it" and the room lights up from... YOUR GIANT FLAMETHROWER.  Lights go out and these white evil eyes start to swarm.  They turn dark red and shake as they get closer.  A tense sound is growing intensely and your mind says, "Run!".  

Player can use the flamethrower to light the way, but there is limited fuel.  If you run out, you must traverse the levels in the dark.  Staying in the dark isn't an option because the little beady eyes keep coming.  It's a race against your flamethrower's fuel limit to get to the end of each level before the beady eyes get ya!

Insert 9 more levels and a big-ass boss at the end and call EA Games.. This shit's in the bag.
